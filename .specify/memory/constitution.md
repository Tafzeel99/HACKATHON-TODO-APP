# Evolution of Todo Constitution
<!-- Constitution for the 5-phase Todo app evolution project -->

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (MANDATORY)
<!-- All work must follow: Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement -->
All code implementation must be preceded by approved specifications and tasks. No agent may write code without an approved spec and corresponding task breakdown. All development follows the sequence: Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement. This ensures alignment between requirements and implementation, prevents feature creep, and maintains traceability.

### II. Agent-First Development
<!-- No manual coding by humans; No feature invention; No deviation from approved specifications -->
All code must be generated by AI agents using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. Human developers may only provide specifications, requirements, and feedback. Agents must not invent features or deviate from approved specifications. Any refinement must occur at the spec level, not at the code level. This ensures consistency and leverages AI capabilities effectively.

### III. Phase-Gated Evolution
<!-- Each phase strictly scoped; No future-phase features in earlier phases -->
Each phase of the project (I-V) must be strictly implemented according to its specification. Features from future phases must not leak into earlier phases. Architecture may evolve only through updated specs and plans within the appropriate phase. This ensures proper progression and prevents scope creep across the evolution.

### IV. Technology Stack Consistency
<!-- Python backend, Next.js frontend, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB, etc. -->
Adherence to the prescribed technology stack throughout the evolution: Python for backend services, Next.js for frontend applications, FastAPI for API development, SQLModel for ORM, Neon DB for serverless PostgreSQL, OpenAI Agents SDK for AI features, MCP for Model Context Protocol, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Kafka for event streaming, and Dapr for distributed application runtime. Deviations require explicit constitutional amendment.

### V. Clean Architecture & Stateless Services
<!-- Maintain separation of concerns; Services must be stateless where possible -->
All services must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers. Services should be stateless where possible to enable horizontal scaling and resilience. This supports the eventual migration to distributed systems in later phases and ensures maintainability.

### VI. Security-First Approach
<!-- Authentication, authorization, and data protection from Phase I -->
Security must be considered from the initial phase, not added later. This includes proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and data protection. JWT-based authentication with Better Auth, secure API design, and proper secrets management must be implemented following security best practices throughout all phases.

## Technology Constraints
<!-- Technology stack requirements for the entire evolution -->
- Python 3.13+ for backend services
- Next.js 16+ with App Router for frontend applications
- FastAPI for API development
- SQLModel for ORM and database operations
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for database storage
- Better Auth with JWT for authentication
- OpenAI Agents SDK for AI functionality
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) SDK for tool integration
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Kafka for event streaming
- Dapr for distributed application runtime
- Vercel for frontend hosting
- Minikube for local Kubernetes deployment
- DigitalOcean Kubernetes for cloud deployment

## Quality Principles
<!-- Standards that apply throughout the evolution -->
- All code must be testable with appropriate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Documentation must be maintained at specification level and implementation level
- Error handling must be comprehensive and consistent across all phases
- Performance considerations must be addressed from Phase I onwards
- Code must be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns
- All implementations must be validated against acceptance criteria in specs

## Governance
<!-- Rules for amending and following this constitution -->
This constitution supersedes all other development practices for the Evolution of Todo project. Amendments require explicit documentation of changes, approval from project stakeholders, and a migration plan for existing artifacts. All pull requests and code reviews must verify constitutional compliance. Deviations from these principles require explicit constitutional amendment before implementation. Use this constitution as the primary reference for all development decisions throughout the 5-phase evolution.
